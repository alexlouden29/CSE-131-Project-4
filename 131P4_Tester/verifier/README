If you have opengl development libraries installed you can verify test cases by editing minimal.frag

Unlike webgl, you can use this to test while loops, switch statements, and more-complex for loops.




How to build:
run bash buildscript.sh   # requires freeglut and glew to be installed
Modifying minimal.frag does not require you to rebuild.


How to run:
./a.out
The output will be green if the test is correct, and red otherwise.




This probably won't work with ieng6. It's best to run on your personal computer, but you can play with the version directive to get it working on ieng6--it just won't necessarily follow the spec.
